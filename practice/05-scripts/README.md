# Scripts

All scripts should be written in a way that takes into account several factors:

1. Use the shebang / make the script executable
2. Error out gracefully --> set -e / error codes --> || exit 1;
3. Use input parameters
4. Conditional logic
5. Environment / full paths / env variables
6. Logging
7. Use comments

## bash

### shebang
A well-formatted `bash` script begins with a "shebang" line:
```
#!/bin/bash
```
that points to the full path of the `bash` shell. This may differ from one environment
to the next.

To make any bit of code executable, use `chmod 755` against it.

### Use full paths

Any binary executables used in a shell script should be invoked using their full
paths. This is to avoid any ambiguity and preempt any errors of a shell not being
able to find the command.

For example, when invoking the `aws` command-line in a script you would normally call
```
/usr/local/bin/aws
```
To determine the full path of an executable in a given system, use the `which` command:
```
which aws
```

### Graceful Errors

In most `bash` shell scripts you may `set -e` near the head of the script. This flag
tells the script that, upon any error, it should escape/exit the script and stop running.
This is important since to proceed past an error may produce very bad results or
unintended consequences.

Another option is to use conditional, such that when a specific line of the script
fails to execute, the failed line can `exit` with a non-zero code. This can be a useful
output for debugging

### Sleep

If you need a deliberate pause in the middle of a script, simply `sleep 5` for a 5-second
pause, etc. This may be especially useful in the midst of `try` logic.

### Input parameters

Remember that `$0`, `$1`, `$2`, etc. are reserved parameters `bash` understands as positional
arguments when invoking from the command-line:

- `$0` is the invoking script itself
- `$1` is the first parameter after the script name
- `$2` is the second parameter ...
- . . .

`positional-args.sh`
```
#!/bin/bash

echo "$0 <-- invoking script"
echo "$1 <-- first parameter"
echo "$2 <-- second parameter"
```
returns the following output:

```
$ ./positional-args.sh bananas blueberries

./positional-args.sh <-- invoking script
bananas <-- first parameter
blueberries <-- second parameter
```


### If/Else conditional logic:

Start your `if` with a comparison, end with `fi`.

```bash
if [[ $VAR -gt 10 ]]
then
  echo "That number is greater than 10."
else
  echo "Your number is pretty small!"
  exit 0;
fi
```

### Environment

`env` gives you all environment variables for your session. This may vary
for an unattended script (without you around).

Add environment variables in `bash`:
```
export VARIABLE=value-of-variable
```

Use full paths to your binaries to avoid your unattended script being unable
to locate a binary. Just because you can run it by hand does not mean it can
run without you around.

### Logging

A simple-yet-valuable step in your scripting is to log. You can log every action
taken by the script, or limit logging to successes or failures.

A common format for logging might be a snippet like this:

```
# First establish the datetime:
NOW=$(date +"%m-%d-%Y-%H:%M:%SEDT")
echo $DATE " OK - Successfully processed " $FILENAME >> /var/log/output.log
```
The result would be a single file building with each row as it is logged.
Note the `>>` to append to a file instead of overwriting it!

### Comment

One of the most useful habits you can develop as a programmer is adding comments
to your code. This explains each chunk of code but might also justify why a particular
choice has been made. This will be invaluable to you, when you come back to the code
two years later, or when your code is shared with others.

## Python3

Scripting in `python` is fairly similar, but it has many a lot more functionality in 
terms of libraries, classes, functions, etc. A few things to note:

- Unlike `bash` it is not as easy to pass `$1`, `$2` parameters in the command-line.
[Refer to this](https://stackabuse.com/command-line-arguments-in-python/) for a basic tutorial.
- Python can invoke shell scripts in other languages.
- Python has many better options for conditional logic, error handling, and logging.
- Whereas `bash` and other low-level tools (`grep`, `sed`, `awk`, `tr`, `perl`, etc.) can parse 
plain-text "flat" files fairly efficiently, Python can ingest a data file and load it 
into memory for much more complex transformations. A library like `pandas` can use 
dataframes like a staging database for you to query, scan, count, etc. [Here's a great
tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/sohier/tutorial-accessing-data-with-pandas) on Kaggle.

## Hands-On Practice

1. Write a primary script in `bash` that does two things:
  - Invokes a `bash` script to retrieve the log file found in `retrieve_file.sh`.
  - Invokes a `python3` script to parse that file and write the output

2. Want a more challenging assignment? Write a `python` script that does both tasks.
