and tools will be distributed in this way so that we all have a common set of tools, scripts, and datasets.

This requires that you clone and stay current with the **course code respository** and have the appropriate
tools to complete exercises. 

## Updating your fork 

To stay current with new releases into the course repository, follow these steps:

1. Add an upstream source
```
git remote add upstream git@github.com:nmagee/ds2002-course.git
```
2. Fetch from the upstream branch:
```
git fetch upstream
```
3. Merge your branch with the upstream branch.
```
git merge upstream/main main
```

This can be run in a single block:
```
git remote add upstream git@github.com:nmagee/ds2002-course.git
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main main
```

## Saving your changes

If you generate code, scripts, data files, etc. that you would like to keep, simply add, commit, and push
the files back to **your** fork of the repository:
```
git add .
git commit -m "Some meaningful message"
git push origin main
```

Remember that changes you commit and push will be saved to YOUR fork of the repository.
